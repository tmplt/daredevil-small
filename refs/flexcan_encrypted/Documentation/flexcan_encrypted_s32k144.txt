                modes: Window,    Timeout and Autonomous. In Window mode (available only in SBC Normal mode), a    watchdog 
                trigger event within a defined watchdog window triggers and resets    the watchdog timer. In Timeout mode, the 
                watchdog runs continuously and can    be triggered and reset at any time within the watchdog period by a 
                watchdog    trigger. Watchdog time-out mode can also be used for cyclic wake-up    of the microcontroller. In 
                Autonomous mode, the watchdog can be off or    autonomously in Timeout mode, depending on the selected SBC mode.
                Note SBC mode will temporary set to StandBy while WatchDog configuration    is changed.
   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_GetWatchdog -This function reads Watchdog control register (0x00).     This function reads Watchdog mode 
                control, and nominal watchdog period.     The UJA1169 contains a watchdog that supports three operating modes: 
                Window,     Timeout and Autonomous. In Window mode (available only in SBC Normal mode), a     watchdog trigger 
                event within a defined watchdog window triggers and resets     the watchdog timer. In Timeout mode, the 
                watchdog runs continuously and can     be triggered and reset at any time within the watchdog period by a 
                watchdog     trigger. Watchdog time-out mode can also be used for cyclic wake-up     of the microcontroller. In

                regulator    V1 is enabled to supply the microcontroller.    Standby mode is the first-level power-saving mode 
                of the UJA1169, offering    reduced current consumption. The transceiver is unable to transmit or    receive 
                data in Standby mode. The SPI remains enabled and V1 is still active;    the watchdog is active (in Timeout 
                mode) if enabled. The behavior    of V2/VEXT is determined by the SPI setting.    Sleep mode is the 
                second-level power-saving mode of the UJA1169.    The difference between Sleep and Standby modes is that V1 is 
                off in    Sleep mode and temperature protection is inactive.    Note event status are cleared before device 
                move to sleep mode.
   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_GetMode -This function reads to Mode control register (0x01).    Normal mode is the active operating mode.

                conditions include    SBC overtemperature events, loss of watchdog service, short-circuits on pins    RSTN or 
                V1 and user-initiated or external reset events (see Figure 7).    The LIMP pin is a battery-robust, active-LOW, 
                open-drain output.    The LIMP pin can also be forced LOW by setting bit LHC in the Fail-safe    control 
                register.    The limp-home function and the reset counter are disabled in    Forced Normal mode. The LIMP pin

                V1 and user-initiated or external reset events (see Figure 7).    The LIMP pin is a battery-robust, active-LOW, 
                open-drain output.    The LIMP pin can also be forced LOW by setting bit LHC in the Fail-safe    control 
                register.    The limp-home function and the reset counter are disabled in    Forced Normal mode. The LIMP pin

                content of overtemperature warning and SPI failure    settings.
   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_SetLock -This function writes Lock control register (0x0A).    Sections of the register address area can 
                be write-protected to protect    against unintended modifications. This facility only protects locked bits    
                from being modified via the SPI and will not prevent the UJA1169 updating    status registers etc. For SPI 
                write disable set lock bit to 1.    This is mask for set lock control register.
   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_GetLock -This function reads Lock control register (0x0A).    Sections of the register address area can 
                be write-protected to protect    against unintended modifications. This facility only protects locked bits

   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_SetWakePin -This function writes WAKE pin event capture enable register (0x4C).    Local wake-up is 
                enabled via bits WPRE and WPFE in the WAKE pin event capture    enable register (see Table 33). A wake-up event 
                is triggered    by a LOW-to-HIGH (ifWPRE = 1) and/or a HIGH-to-LOW (if WPFE = 1) transition    on the WAKE pin. 
                This arrangement allows for maximum flexibility when    designing a local wake-up circuit. In applications that 
                do not use the local    wake-up facility, local wake-up should be disabled and the WAKE pin    connected to GND.
   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_GetWakePin -This function reads WAKE pin event capture enable register (0x4C).    Local wake-up is 
                enabled via bits WPRE and WPFE in the WAKE pin event capture    enable register. A wake-up event is triggered   
                by a LOW-to-HIGH (ifWPRE = 1) and/or a HIGH-to-LOW (if WPFE = 1) transition    on the WAKE pin. This 
                arrangement allows for maximum flexibility when    designing a local wake-up circuit. In applications that do 
                not use the local    wake-up facility, local wake-up should be disabled and the WAKE pin    connected to GND.

                maximum of 200 times (Ncy(W)MTP).    Bit NVMPS in the MTPNV status register indicates    whether the 
                non-volatile cells can be reprogrammed. This register also    contains a write counter, WRCNTS, that is 
                incremented each time the    MTPNV cells are reprogrammed (up to a maximum value of 111111; there is    no 
                overflow; performing a factory reset also increments the counter).    This counter is provided for information 
                purposes only; reprogramming will    not be rejected when it reaches its maximum value.
   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_GetFactoriesSettings -This function reads Start-up control register and    SBC configuration control 
                register.    It is non-volatile memory with limited write access.    The UJA1169 contains Multiple Time 
                Programmable Non-Volatile    (MTPNV) memory cells that allow some of the default device settings    to be 
                reconfigured. The MTPNV memory address range is from 0x73 to 0x74.    NXP delivers the UJA1169 in so-called 
                Forced Normal mode,    also referred to as the factory preset configuration. In order    to change the default 
                settings, the device must be in Forced Normal mode    with FNMC = 1 and NVMPS = 1. In Forced Normal mode, the 
                watchdog is disabled,    all regulators are on and the CAN transceiver is in Active mode.
   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_ChangeFactoriesSettings -This function sets Start-up control register and    SBC configuration control 
                register.    It is non-volatile memory with limited write access.    The UJA1169 contains Multiple Time 
                Programmable Non-Volatile    (MTPNV) memory cells that allow some of the default device settings    to be 
                reconfigured. The MTPNV memory address range is from 0x73 to 0x74.    NXP delivers the UJA1169 in so-called 
                Forced Normal mode,    also referred to as the factory preset configuration. In order    to change the default 
                settings, the device must be in Forced Normal mode    with FNMC = 1 and NVMPS = 1. In Forced Normal mode, the 
                watchdog is disabled,    all regulators are on and the CAN transceiver is in Active mode.    Note for default 
                settings see sbc_factories_conf_t comment.    If the device has been programmed previously, the factory presets 
                may need    to be restored before reprogramming can begin. When the factory presets    have been restored 
                successfully, a system reset is generated automatically    and UJA1169 switches back to Forced Normal mode.    
                Factory preset values are restored if the following conditions apply    continuously for at least td(MTPNV) 
                during battery power-up:    -pin RSTN is held LOW    -CANH is pulled up to VBAT    -CANL is pulled down to GND
   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_DataTransfer -This function sends data over LSPI to SBC device.    This function sends 8 bites to SBC 
                device register according device address    which is selected. This transfer uses 16bit LSPI. CS polarity - 
                active low,    clock phase on second edge. Clock polarity active high.
   - sbc_uja11691_SBC_FeedWatchdog -This function refreshes watchdog period by writing byte to    the SBC watchdog register. 
                This function must be called periodically    according Watchdog mode control and Nominal watchdog period 
                settings.    Note: Unxpected behaviour can happend if watchdog mode is set to timeout    period and watchdog is 
                triggered exactly at 50% of period.    Be sure you trigger watchdog before 50% or above 50% of watchdog period.
